The data set represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks.

It is important to know if a patient will be readmitted in some hospital. The reason is that you can change the treatment, in order to avoid a readmission.

In this database, you have 3 different outputs:

1. No readmission;
2. A readmission in less than 30 days (this situation is not good, because maybe your treatment was not appropriate);
3. A readmission in more than 30 days (this one is not so good as well the last one, however, the reason can be the state of the patient.
